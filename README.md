As part of Project Management course, I functioned as a full stack by building a website that simulates a system for the sport community, 
with the ability to sign up as a coach or as a sportsman.
The main goals of the site are: to gain greater exposure as a coach, upload training and closely monitor the sportsmans.
And as a sportsman, choose the appropriate level and receive close personal guidance by a selected coach in a selected sport type.
